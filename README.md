# GDPR Integration for Community Services

This repository contains a simple Flask application to be used with the centralized
[GDPR automation workflow](https://github.com/canonical/gdpr-workflows). It also
contains the packaging metadata for creating a ROCK of the Flask application.
For more information on ROCKs, visit the
[rockcraft Github](https://github.com/canonical/rockcraft). The application can
be deployed using the
[Charmed Flask K8s Operator](https://charmhub.io/flask-k8s).

For more information on deployment, please find the documentation in the
[GDPR Integration Template](https://github.com/canonical/gdpr-integration-template-py)
